The\nperiod of life, when the body undergoes\nchanges, leading to reproductive\nmaturity, is called adolescence.\nAdolescence begins around the age of\n11 and lasts upto 18 or 19 years of age.\nSince this period covers the ‘teens’ (13\nto 18 or 19 years of age), adolescents\nare also called ‘teenagers’. In girls,\nadolescence may begin a year or two\nearlier than in boys. Also, the period of\nadolescence varies from person to person.\nThe human body undergoes several\nchanges during adolescence. These\nchanges mark the onset of puberty. The\nmost important change which marks\npuberty is that boys and girls become\ncapable of reproduction. Puberty ends\nwhen an adolescent reaches reproductive\nmaturity.\nREACHING THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE\nREACHING THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE\n2024-25\nSCIENCE\n80\n% of full height\nBoys\nGirls\n8\n72%\n77%\n9\n75%\n81%\n10\n78%\n84%\n11\n81%\n88%\n12\n84%\n91%\n13\n88%\n95%\n14\n92%\n98%\n15\n95%\n99%\n16\n98%\n99.5%\n17\n99%\n100%\n18\n100%\n100%\nAge in\nYears\nPaheli and Boojho\nrealised that sudden\nincrease in height and\nhairy line above the lips\nin boys were signs of\nadolescence.

The\ncapacity for maturation  and production\nof gametes lasts for a much longer time\nin males than in females.\nIn females, the reproductive phase of\nlife begins at puberty (10 to 12 years of\nage) and generally lasts till the age of\napproximately 45 to 50 years. The ova\nbegin to mature with the onset of\npuberty. One ovum matures and is\nreleased by one of the ovaries once in\nabout 28 to 30 days. During this\nperiod, the wall of the uterus becomes\nthick so as to receive the egg, in case\nit is fertilised and begins to develop.\nThis results in pregnancy. If\nfertilisation does not occur, the\nreleased egg, and the thickened lining\nof the uterus along with its blood\nvessels are shed off. This causes\nbleeding in women which is called\nmenstruation. Menstruation occurs\nonce in about 28 to 30 days. The first\nmenstrual flow begins at puberty  and\nis termed menarche. At 45 to 50 years\nof age, the menstrual cycle stops.\nStoppage of menstruation is termed\nmenopause. Initially, menstrual cycle\nmay be irregular.

Before being hit, the ball was at\nrest and so its speed was zero. The\napplied force makes the ball move\ntowards the goal. Suppose, the\ngoalkeeper dives or jumps up to save the\ngoal. By his action the goalkeeper tries\nto apply a force on the moving ball. The\nforce applied by him can stop or deflect\nthe ball, saving a goal being scored. If\nthe goalkeeper succeeds in stopping the\nball, its speed decreases to zero.\nThese observations suggest that a\nforce applied on an object may change\nits speed. If the force applied on the object\nis in the direction of its motion, the speed\nof the object increases. If the force is\napplied in the direction opposite to the\ndirection of motion, then it results in a\ndecrease in the speed of the object.\n2024-25\nSCIENCE\n98\nLet us consider some more\nexamples. In a game of volleyball,\nplayers often push the moving ball to\ntheir team mates to make a winning\nmove. Sometimes the ball is returned\nto the other side of the court by\npushing or smashing it. In cricket, a\nbatsman plays his or her shot by\napplying a force on the ball with the\nbat. Is there any change in the\ndirection of motion of the ball in these\ncases? In all these examples the speed\nand the direction of the moving ball\nchange due to the application of a\nforce. Can you give a few more\nexamples of this kind?\nA change in either the speed of an\nobject, or its direction of motion, or both,\nis described as a change in its state of\nmotion.

Can you lift\na bucket of water without holding it?\nGenerally, to apply a force on an object,\nyour body has to be in contact with the\nobject. The contact may also be with the\nhelp of a stick or a piece of rope.  When\nwe push an object like a school bag or\nlift a bucket of water, where does the\nforce come from? This force is caused\nby the action of muscles in our body.\nThe force resulting due to the action of\nmuscles is known as the muscular\nforce.\nIt is the muscular force that enables\nus to perform all activities involving\nmovement or bending of our body. In\nClass VII you have learnt that in the\nprocess of digestion the food gets\npushed through the alimentary canal.\nCould it be a muscular force that does\nit? You also know that lungs expand\nand contract while we inhale and\nexhale air during breathing. Where\nare these muscles located which\nmake breathing possible? Can you list\na few more examples of the force\nexerted by the muscles in our body?\nAnimals also make use of muscular\nforce to carry out their physical activities\nand other tasks. Animals like bullocks,\nhorses, donkeys and camels are used to\nperform various tasks for us. In\nperforming these tasks they use\nmuscular force (Fig. 8.9).\n2024-25\nFORCE AND PRESSURE\n101\nSince muscular force can be applied\nonly when it is in contact with an object,\nit is also called a contact force. Are there\nother types of contact forces? Let us find\nout.\nFriction\nRecall some of your experiences. A ball\nrolling along the ground gradually slows\ndown and finally comes to rest. When\nwe stop pedalling a bicycle, it gradually\nslows down and finally comes to a stop.\nA car or a scooter also comes to rest\nonce its engine is switched off. Similarly,\na boat comes to rest if we stop rowing\nit. Can you add some more such\nexperiences?\nIn all these situations no force\nappears to be acting on the objects, yet\ntheir speed gradually decreases and\nthey come to rest after some time. What\ncauses a change in their state of motion?\nCould some force be acting on them!\nCan you guess the direction in which\nthe force must be acting in each case?\nThe force responsible for changing the\nstate of motion of objects in all these\nexamples is the force of friction. It is the\nforce of friction between the surface of\nthe ball and the ground that brings the\nmoving ball to rest. Similarly, friction\nbetween water and the boat brings it to\na stop once you stop rowing.\nThe force of friction always acts on\nall the moving objects and its direction\nis always opposite to the direction of\nmotion. Since the force of friction arises\ndue to contact between surfaces, it is\nalso an example of a contact force. You\nwill learn more about this force in\nChapter 9.\nYou may be wondering whether it is\nessential for the agent applying a force\non an object to be always in contact with\nit. Let us find out."
